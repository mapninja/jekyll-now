### Objectives
* To allow researchers, scholars and do-gooders to do more meaningful work by helping them investigate, quantify and solve spatial problems with technology.  
* To concern myself with issues of import to academic researchers, from building information literacy skills programs tailored to cutting-edge use of geospatial data and technologies, to issues of discovery, access and persistence of the data sources and products of research and teaching in Higher Education. 
* To surround myself with people smarter than me.  
* To always be doing something at least moderately amazing.  
* To elevate the work of impactful, brilliant people.
